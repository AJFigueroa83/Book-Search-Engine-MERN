## Description

ðŸ”Ž This application has been refactored from a RESTful app to a MERN app. It is a book search engine that enables the user to search for their favorite book or books and be able to save them for future reference. Essentially the user can create their own wishlist to purchase the books they like later. The application also features a delete feature to remove the books that you are no longer interested in or have bought or read.



## Installation

ðŸ’¾ No installation required from the user. 

## Usage
Upon opening the page the user is able to start the search for books. If the user wants to be able to save their favorite books, then they will have to signup, if it's their first visit or login with theri credentials. Once the signup or login process is completed the user can do their search and be able to click on save book at the bottom of the description of the book they liked. They will also be able to click on the see save books link on the upper right corner to view the list of books they saved. There they will also see the button that allows them to delete the book from the list if they no longer need/want the book.
